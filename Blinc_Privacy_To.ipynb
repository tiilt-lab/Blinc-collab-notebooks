The platform also provides transcripts of what exactly each student says. The data capture platform allows for real-time monitoring of discussion. It highlights keyword usage, displays what direction audio is coming from, records full sentences and sentences surrounding keywords, and interprets tone of discussion. The data capture platform records discussions, and provides analysis of the discussion. It allows you to track key words as well as monitoring certain things such as confusion or engagement. It allows analyzing how the discussion goes to be more scientific and effective. It\\'s also good for review after the fact since the data will be present and you won\\'t have to rely on your own memory. The platform is meant to collect student data for use in the classroom so that students may be instructed more personally Please provide 2-3 sentences about the purpose and functionality of the data capture platform described in the video.  I understand how this information might be useful for supporting learning.Please provide 2-3 sentences about the purpose and functionality of the data capture platform described in the video.  I understand how this information might be useful for supporting learning. The capture platform keeps track of conversations and can detect various aspects. Some important ones include the direction in which discussion came from and the tone/mood.  The platform records audio from individuals\\' devices, using machine learning to analyze and categorize group discussions. It allows you to see when individuals were actively collaborating, when questions were being asked, and when members were silent, and it also shows the overall tone/mood of the discussion. It can be used to analyze the broad characteristics of a conversation like contribution dynamics and tone. The data capture platform allows groups to track collaboration quality both during and after collaboration. It also allows groups to stay organized and on top of all tasks. Paying attention to participation data during the collaboration is particularly important for the analysis of the collaboration. The online dashboard that gives the discussion facilitator several real-time insights into each group. The purpose is to observe collaborative learning. The functionality is an online dashboard that gives the discussion facilitator key insights into the group dynamics. It seems like the purpose of the tool is to capture important insights about what is said in the recordings that may not be easily noticeable by a human, such as keywords and other nuances/rhetoric of the speech. I think it could definitely provide some information that people don\\'t notice every day. It is supposed to be used to anlalyze speech on multiple different levels. These levels seem to include subject matter, tone, and emotion among others. I think this is a really cool device that could have a lots of potential. The purpose of this data capture platform is to enhance group collaboration by collecting and analyzing certain metrics. It is meant to be used by group members.  The purpose of the device is to gain insight into what is going on in discussion. It listens to discussions and provides metrics like a timeline of type of statement and measure of emotion level.  It has keywords list that can easily find what you are looking for. It also has timeline control that can mange every topic\\'s discussion time.   The purpose is to help discussion leaders (or teachers) understand the dynamics of their group that they are watching over through a device. This will serve to ease the difficulties of managing large classrooms or groups where there is a small teacher to student ratio. Indivudals are recorded and their key words are detected to better understand the contributing dynamics. The purpose and functionality of the data capture platform is to obtain live data on people as they speak. It captures things such as tone and the words that they say.  The platform is pretty useful for highlighting the most important moments of a discussion. Based on keywords you can have a better experience reviewing the audio of a discussion, such as a lecture. able to capture the necessary information given by a lecturer. based on the ton of voice, the platform is able to take that into account to get information  I think the purpose of this data capture platform is to understand how a group of collaborators discuss and engage. More specifically there is a case by case basis of tone and analytics of the entire discussion to help understand how some groups collaborate.   To record and monitor discussion, also sentiment and content analysis after the discussion The data capture platform is able to recognize patterns and trends in the conversations that are happening during group discussions. I was particularly impressed by the keyword detection mechanism which would help identify the direction of conversations/common topics that come up the platform allows teachers to properly facilitate online collaborative learning. Teachers can use the platform to track discussions, and better direct discussions.  Can automatically generate keywords for chatting, convert voice messages into text messages, and visually display the quiet time The data capture platform allows teachers to get better insight into student discussion. Teachers can see specific parts of the discussion, what keywords are being used, and the tone of the discussion.  Capture keywords discussed in a discussion and make them be useful to review or do some deep analyze. This application provides a summary of what was said in a collaborative discussion environment. For example, it can tell you which person was talking the most, what words were repeated a lot, etc. The purpose of this data capture platform is to capture recordings of conversations in the classroom as the ratio between students and teachers has increased over the years. This makes it so teachers can listen in to these collaboration sessions. The functionality of the platform includes picking up of keywords and showing what is said around it and different qualities of the conversation (like clout or tone). Teachers can\\'t evaluate every groups tone. The data capture platform can indicate how well a group is working together by evaluating the tone of the conversations within groups. It can help students collaborate better in the class. It gives the discussion facilitator several real-time insights into each group. Record discussions and analyze them to extract helpful information to improve learning and collaboration This data collection and display system provides insight to teachers or professors with classes so large, they can\\'t hear the discussions of so many small student groups. So, they have audio capture devices for each group with analytics to identify the key words repeated in discussion, which can be filtered over time, or placed in context of the transcript. As a result, the teacher can get an idea of what students seem to most discuss. Purpose is to provide insight to groups about the types of conversations they are having and what direction the conversations are heading. It does this by having microphones on your device that pickup conversations and analyze it in real-time with their AI. It is a platform that analyzes group discussions. It specifically tracks certain keywords and the direction off discussions to understand how functional discussions are. The purpose and functionality of the data capture platform is to give a discussion facilitator several real-time insights into groups. This platform highlights how some metrics are changing over the short-term of discussions to highlight trends to provide more insight into what is happening within the group.  It was to teach us about how to conduct data capture, and ways to filter out keywords from the video.  The data capture platform was used to track the ebb and flow of a discussion. It tracked when things were said and when there was silence. It also logged key words like \"hate\" to track the emotional tone of the conversation. AI will listen to the conversation and pick out certain keywords. It will allow the instructor to customize and access information on the discussion and break-down the collaboration session into statistics. The data capture platform provides key insight into various metrics that can analyze the group interactivity such as most common keywords, the majority of sound coming from particular direction, or even the content of discussion being classfied. Thus, the data capture platform provides a good idea of how the discussion overall went and what can be done to improve for future sessions. To analyze discussion and give real time metrics of the quality of the discussion. It keeps track of things like keywords, the quality of the voices, and also keeps a transcript of the discussion. The platform records your voice and a transcript of everything that was said. It analyzes things like the tone of your voice to note things like confusion. The transcript will also keep track of key words to help hone in on important topics. This is an interesting tool that can be used to provide feedback on the efficacy of collaboration. This feed back can then be used to inform collaborators on how to communicate more effectively.  The purpose of the video is to propose a new app that is being developed to increase efficiency of listening to lecture. The app transcribes and evaluate the data to help see which parts of the lecture was important. It generate the word from the audio. It provide the information about the works, the tones, score, e.t.c.  I think this data capture platform is a way to monitor the state of a collaboration in real time. It gives the facilitator an indication of what\\'s going well and what\\'s not. The purpose of the platform was to provide teams with a way of monitoring their discussions. For instance by using a microphone the platform is able to capture audio live from the discussion. This audio is then transcribed and reveals useful information that it tracks such as emotional tone, analytical thinking, etc.  The data capture platform allows input from microphones.  This is analyzed for keywords using AI.  It can then be analyzed after a collaboration. Computer Science is an important field to work in.

It visualized the captured data on the platform and able to somehow abstract away the data collecting process. The app gives discussion facilitators real-time insights into student groups which enhances collaboration. You can use Respeakers to start discussions based on key words. I believe the data captured is useful to understand how the team members are communicating with each other. In the case that there is too much negativity or harsh words that are being said in a group, it would be great to quickly understand what is going on and whether everyone in that group is comfortable with that is being said The platform describes seems to primarily be used to record discussions in a group and then allow one to analyze the discussion. Various details can be assessed like searching for keywords, the amount of questions being asked/answered, the amount of silence, etc. The data capture platform captures real time data about the discussion. It can track the frequency of certain words and also track the emotional tone the conversation is moving in. I t was a voice recording tool. it was used to search for keywords in a discussion and attempt to track collaboration.  I understand the intent behind monitoring and classifying group discussion, but I really don’t believe this will be helpful. I imagine that this would just make group mates afraid to interact genuinely and hamper communications instead of aiding them. The purpose of the platform is to make the group work more effectively. And it helps the group members. The data capture platform described in the video aims to give insights (information) about group discussions through the use of Machine Learning. The application records the discussion, and based on given keywords, calculates metrics such as emotional tone, analytic thinking, etc. This app can be used to understand how collaborations/discussions have progressed. The purpose of the platform is to gather audio data from a collaboration to understand the quality of the collaboration. The data can be used to know different aspects that worked well or fell flat (analytical thinking, clout). The data platform provides extremely useful collaboration statistics such as discussion direction.  This ensures that group work time is spent productively and time isn\\'t wasted as much.   The data platform can be used to analyze collaboration sessions and provide feedback on areas of strength and areas of growth.
