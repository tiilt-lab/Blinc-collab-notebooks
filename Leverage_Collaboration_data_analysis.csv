R_12PcLTnA7K58yrd,"It appears to give both live feedback on the nature of a discussion which is also recorded for future reference. This allows users to be evaluated for their contributions in a variety of categories which may more effectively inform users how to improve their group collaborations in the future (eg. dominating the conversation, lots of emotional verbiage, lack of novel or intellectual contributions, etc.)","How much of the project can they actually explain all the way down to the fundamentals why certain choices were made. Someone who just exists in a group can tell you what the outcome to a problem was, but only someone who was doing the work of solving the problem can tell you every intricate detail of what issues came up and how exactly it was solved. Details--this is the same for technical interviews.","Does the final product look like a collection of separate projects stitched together arbitrarily, or are all the components seamlessly integrated together. A smart group of people can all solve their own problems extremely well, but unless they're collaborating effectively as a group, their final product will look like just that--a collection of solutions instead of one unified solution. ","How effectively does everyone in the group understand their larger roles and responsibilities towards the final goal, and how are they accounting for that in their designs. ","Looking for gaps or disconnects. If two projects clearly don't understand or aren't aware of their interactions, that would be the role of the leader to step in and connect the two parties to ensure all interactions are properly understood and accounted for--this avoids disconnects at the end where an interface was not properly designed, if at all. ","This is the best time for feedback about how effectively someone was able to understand and act on the requirements and expectations of those around them. Someone isn't necessarily improve significantly during the time of collaboration, so feedback from fellow collaborators after the fact on pain points and/or how to improve would be valuable. ","Using this feedback from collaborators in retrospect to understand what could be improved over the course of a project or to know potential pain points that, while you might not know how to improve them, you can warn others about and attempt to avoid, can make future collaborations far more efficient and valuable.

Good collaboration is, ‚Äúwhen someone takes your ideas, tells you you‚Äôre crazy or impossible, and then works with you to make them better,‚Äù said Engineering Manager Sean Xie.  Fellow Engineering Manager Dennis Stevense added that to him, being able to brainstorm together is a critical element of good collaboration. It‚Äôs about ‚Äújamming on ideas to come up with a creative solution to a challenging problem together.‚Äù","Good collaboration requires inclusivity. Our Research Design Lead Heather Young explained, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs voice is heard, and everyone feels their opinion is valued.‚Äù She also pointed out that it‚Äôs essential for everyone to understand their role and the power of their own skillsets amongst the group. ""The most important thing is that everyone is aligned on what value they bring to the table, what the mechanism for collaboration is, and what the intended outcomes are.‚Äù","According to Head of Strategic Sales Maggie Peressini, good collaboration is ‚Äúwhen everyone is focused and working on the same outcome.‚Äù Whether you‚Äôre ‚Äúlooped in‚Äù or ‚Äúworking in lockstep‚Äù or ‚Äúaligned towards end goals‚Äù, good collaboration requires that everyone know who‚Äôs responsible for what, when it‚Äôs being done, and what the end product should look like.","Alone it‚Äôs easy to burn out. Good collaboration prevents that, allowing you to move at a pace that feels manageable and can survive the long haul. Software engineer Flavien David said, ‚ÄúAlone you will probably go faster, but surely you won‚Äôt last long. As a team that collaborates, you will always be more resilient and go further.‚Äù","Sometimes the temptation to engage in post hoc analysis is motivated by a desire to produce positive results or see a project as successful. In the case of pharmaceutical research, there may be significant financial consequences to a failed trial."

I think its also important to have group members mention their relevant experience and willingness to learn, just so the team can gauge the individual skill sets and how they can best be utilized.","Communication is the best indicator of collaboration in my opinion. If a group is very communicative and members are able to articulate and explain their work to each other well, then that group is very likely to be able to collaborate really well. Level of commitment also impacts collaboration quality because it can be frustrating and difficult to work with group members who are not committed or interested in the work at all.","Metrics on communication would be helpful - how often each member communicates, how relevant/important these communications are, how well the other team members listen/understand etc.",I think these metrics could help the team direct and navigate their discussions better.
