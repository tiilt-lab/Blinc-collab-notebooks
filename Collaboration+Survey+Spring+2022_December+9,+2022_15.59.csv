Clear, actionable deliverables on a well-documented timeline agreed upon and regularly updated by all parties is one of the most effective ways to resolve any problem efficiently.

","Don't be afraid to step in and lead a room, but never force you way to the top. If someone else is already clearly leading without issue, trying to step up will just introduce clashes and awkward power dynamics. 
Give and take all advice as feedback on your work, not on you as a person. If someone says your work is trash, that doesn't mean *you* are trash. Likewise, if someone else's work *is* trash, call it out. Don't let bad work go into a finished product just because you were too afraid to call it out. In some fields, that could even put lives on the line. 
Never be afraid to learn more. If someone says something that doesn't make sense to you, don't just ignore it and don't arbitrarily challenge it. Ask questions. Understand their reasoning. Maybe they just didn't think it through, maybe they don't have a fundamental understanding of the problem, or maybe they do and you learn something new. ","How much of the project can they actually explain all the way down to the fundamentals why certain choices were made. Someone who just exists in a group can tell you what the outcome to a problem was, but only someone who was doing the work of solving the problem can tell you every intricate detail of what issues came up and how exactly it was solved. Details--this is the same for technical interviews.","Does the final product look like a collection of separate projects stitched together arbitrarily, or are all the components seamlessly integrated together. A smart group of people can all solve their own problems extremely well, but unless they're collaborating effectively as a group, their final product will look like just that--a collection of solutions instead of one unified solution. ","How effectively does everyone in the group understand their larger roles and responsibilities towards the final goal, and how are they accounting for that in their designs. ","Looking for gaps or disconnects. If two projects clearly don't understand or aren't aware of their interactions, that would be the role of the leader to step in and connect the two parties to ensure all interactions are properly understood and accounted for--this avoids disconnects at the end where an interface was not properly designed, if at all. ","This is the best time for feedback about how effectively someone was able to understand and act on the requirements and expectations of those around them. Someone isn't necessarily improve significantly during the time of collaboration, so feedback from fellow collaborators after the fact on pain points and/or how to improve would be valuable. ","Using this feedback from collaborators in retrospect to understand what could be improved over the course of a project or to know potential pain points that, while you might not know how to improve them, you can warn others about and attempt to avoid, can make future collaborations far more efficient and valuable. ","It would need to be a mix of short collaboration sprints and extended collaboration exercises. The short sprints can quickly bring to light the learnings one could see both from immediate issues as well as the issues over the span of a project, and longer collaboration over the span of weeks or months could more effectively bring to light issues and feedback which may not become apparent over short time scales (eg. inconsistent work output without proper communication) ","Collaborating effectively is a skill that you learn over time, and it isn't the same for everyone. Everyone has different fundamental skills they can play off differently, and no one is perfect--many people have issues they may not be able to overcome, so a more personalized solution to remedy these shortcomings may be more effective for some.

This course alone allowed for a large amount of growth in my problem solving skills through collaboration. We worked through physics problems sets as a group. Without a TA to ""fall back on"" we had to put our best effort forward to think together. It quickly proved very effective. We were all able to contribute valuable information and ideas.

","Be willing to collaborate. For me the most important part of collaboration is wanting to collaborate.

However, when team members seem to always reference “I” when discussing projects rather than “we,” you may find that collaboration is suffering as staff have taken a more siloed approach to work.",Team members feel nervous to give feedback or are unable to accept it themselves.," Team members would like to  take responsibility or admit to mistakes.When it comes to developing something totally new, good collaboration means having honesty and willingness to change to make things better. Good collaboration is, “when someone takes your ideas, tells you you’re crazy or impossible, and then works with you to make them better,” said Engineering Manager Sean Xie.  Fellow Engineering Manager Dennis Stevense added that to him, being able to brainstorm together is a critical element of good collaboration. It’s about “jamming on ideas to come up with a creative solution to a challenging problem together.”","Good collaboration requires inclusivity. Our Research Design Lead Heather Young explained, “Everyone’s voice is heard, and everyone feels their opinion is valued.” She also pointed out that it’s essential for everyone to understand their role and the power of their own skillsets amongst the group. ""The most important thing is that everyone is aligned on what value they bring to the table, what the mechanism for collaboration is, and what the intended outcomes are.”","According to Head of Strategic Sales Maggie Peressini, good collaboration is “when everyone is focused and working on the same outcome.” Whether you’re “looped in” or “working in lockstep” or “aligned towards end goals”, good collaboration requires that everyone know who’s responsible for what, when it’s being done, and what the end product should look like.","Alone it’s easy to burn out. Good collaboration prevents that, allowing you to move at a pace that feels manageable and can survive the long haul. Software engineer Flavien David said, “Alone you will probably go faster, but surely you won’t last long. As a team that collaborates, you will always be more resilient and go further.”","Sometimes the temptation to engage in post hoc analysis is motivated by a desire to produce positive results or see a project as successful. In the case of pharmaceutical research, there may be significant financial consequences to a failed trial.","Alone it’s easy to burn out.

A lot of times a single member of a group will lead the other students or guide the conversation. This is fine if they are helping to guide the work in a productive way, but the team should still be listening and engaging with each other. I have had projects in the past where partners are uninterested in the opinions of the rest of the group or group members are disengaged. This is a poor example collaboration and undermines the value of group work. Good collaboration should make it easy and enjoyable for group members to work together and requires good listening skills, where each member is eager to participate in their own way.","Bad collaboration occurs when group mates are uninterested in participating or when a subset within the group is not making space for others to participate. It is okay if people want to participate/engage in different ways, but group mates should definitely be trying to listen to each other.","I usually try my best to stay engaged as best I can. I find that staying engaged and participating makes my experience better and usually encourages other group mates to also keep engaging. I also make sure to do my part of a project, as it is frustrating for the rest of the group when team members are not following through with their committed role.","I have always been taught that collaboration is good, that it encourages and expedites creativity and the creation of a successful product. It is also a skill that is really important in the work environment, so being a good team member is always beneficial. ","I think it is important to try and get contact info and set up a meeting with your team right away. Delaying the preliminary/planning meeting make group work difficult and makes it harder for your team to collaborate, since you don't yet have an understanding of each person's skill sets. Good communication is critical for good group work, so always be sure to bee communicating with your team and try to practice explaining your ideas and work in an articulate but concise manner.","I think its good to have a little information about their schedule and the amount of time they can commit to the project so you can decide on times to meet and also develop realistic expectations regarding what amount of work they can complete. I think its also important to have group members mention their relevant experience and willingness to learn, just so the team can gauge the individual skill sets and how they can best be utilized.","Communication is the best indicator of collaboration in my opinion. If a group is very communicative and members are able to articulate and explain their work to each other well, then that group is very likely to be able to collaborate really well. Level of commitment also impacts collaboration quality because it can be frustrating and difficult to work with group members who are not committed or interested in the work at all.","Metrics on communication would be helpful - how often each member communicates, how relevant/important these communications are, how well the other team members listen/understand etc.",I think these metrics could help the team direct and navigate their discussions better. If the metrics are demonstrating a lack of engagement or listening then they can redirect the conversation to try to keep people engaged with each other.,Probably similar information on the communications between group members. It would also be helpful to document each group members contributions and how they worked with one another to see if the group actually collaborated well.,This info could give insight into how much the group is actually collaborating and if these collaborations are skewed with individual team members not being engaged or not being listend to etc. This could help redirect the team and also help individuals better recognize their strengths and weaknesses during group work.,"In my ideal world, I think collaboration should start a lot earlier in school and be used a lot more frequently. Most school assignments are designed for the individual or are graded individually, which does not necessary reflect how the work environment is set up. I think collaboration is also more than just meeting and splitting up the work, so ideally I would want to be taught to actually work with smaller groups in a way that is productive and focused.",n/a,33.445,33.445,153.141,1,"It seems like the tool captures real time data on communication while collaboration is occuring.
