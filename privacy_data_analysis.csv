I mean that completely respectfully. Is there enough research evidence though, that there is a real problem with how collaboration plays out that this tool is honestly necessary? It kind of just feels like sure, it is interesting, but presumably it is a paid product and I don't know that it would be worth it. People could just learn a bit about what is useful collaboration in some sort of online course, discussion, etc. and then just try themselves to be as effective as possible. I think most people want to have positive collaboration sessions and most of the time they do. It just seems unnecessary/that it tries to solve a problem that isn't big enough to warrant this solution. However, I haven't read too many peer-reviewed articles on this topic and if there is a lot of supportive research that suggests there is a big big issue that really impacts productivity etc and if you genuinely have extensive, peer-reviewed research evidence (that has not been manipulated to present false data) that using this product solves this problem significantly more than a workshop/online class (I know those exist already) on collaboration would, then I think it's a useful idea. But I think a lot of evidence and data is needed on this and I would need to see that before I could genuinely say it is a useful product. However, it does seem creative.
