Also when someone without understanding the actual concept copies one's work.,I try to avoid people I know who practice bad collaboration and try work around a problem on my own. I especially solve problems on my own and avoid bad collaboration by engaging with those other students as Office Hours sessions. ,One should always try to attempt a problem with complete effort and only when one does not understand then they should consult with others.,Start early with homework and regularly attend office hours. Essentially office hour sessions are the best platforms for constructive collaboration and clears many doubts while improving concepts.,Teamwork and consistent effort essentially helps in collaboration. I think starting early is the ideal situation and one should make constructive effort before consulting others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
